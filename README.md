# LishiKeyCuttingGuides
3D printable files for the ersatz Pak-A-Punch developed by Deviant and Tony of 3D Locksport

To those who do not know of the history of the Pak-A-Punch, by the way... that tool was the brainchild of Ricky Lee King (and his collaborator Rob Robinson, both from Richmond, VA) who was the main individual behind A-1 Security Manufacturing.  With multiple patents to his name, his contribution to the locksmithing world was immense and his passing leaves a significant void in our industry.  When Mr. King passed away, the A-1 company appeared to die along with him.  Thus, the Pak-A-Punch is no longer available.

A number of improvised and ersatz hacks to replace it have been kludged together in the past, but here at Red Team Tools we wanted to offer something a bit more robust and functional than what's been put out there in the past.  None of us could likely ever replace the Pak-A-Punch, but this small set of guides that attach to the Lishi Key Cutter helps us come close, perhaps!

By attaching these printed guide blocks to the front end of a pair of Lishi Key Nipper Pliers (also sold here on Red Team Tools) you can make calibrated cuts to your key blade at the proper manufacturer bitting depths for Schlage systems.  (It is nearly impossible to make an accurate 0-depth cut on a key blade using Lishi Nippers so we recommend that users start with 0-bitted, pre-scored key blanks during this process.  Such keys will also help to ensure that your cuts are made at the proper position laterally along the blade.)

Additional description and demonstration of the use of these Key Cutter Guides can be seen in this video here...
